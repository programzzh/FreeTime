# FreeTime
when i feel lost, i always look for new goals to challenge.
As time went on, i realized what i had to do.
Time is gold, however, i spend a lot of time on the trivia of life, therefore, i want to change myself.
For a better tomorrow, i made up my mind to accomplish everything.
So when i have free time, i like to think about new things.
If you are confused, welcome to join us.
I will progress with you and achieve goals.
